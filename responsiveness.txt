Locking orientation: you can lock the orientation of the app to make it only available on certain orientations, u can do that by
importing the services package and doing this

import 'package:flutter/services.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  SystemChrome.setPreferredOrientations([
    DeviceOrientation.portraitDown
  ]).then(
    (value){runApp(
      RunEverything(),
    );}
  );
}

u can lock the orientation in certain modes like portraitDown, portaitup, landscaperight, and lanscapeleft, it accepts a list so u can
allow more than 1 orientation.

Adjust to different sizes: You can use MediaQuery.of(Context).size.width or height or aspect ratio, to let the screen display stuff
differently based on the size, aspectratio is the width/height, u can use if statements or terenary expressions to check if the width
or height is bigger or equal or less than a specific height to display items differently. u can check if aspectratio > 1 to display
items in landscape.

expanded makes it so the widget takes up as much height or width as it can, so when you have 2 items in a row, and both items have
a width of double.infinity, or if both items take up more width than the actual screen, u wrap both items with expanded to make it so
both items take up as much width as they can while still fitting in the screen, 

you can also use MediaQuery(context).of.viewinsets.bottom or top or whatever to return the width or height of items that pop on the screen
like keyboards. then u can adjust the items to scroll when the keyboard is on the screen.

for cameras and battery icons that are on top, u can set useSafeArea to true in the modal sheet to make sure that the phone icons arent
overlapping modal sheet components, scaffold widget automatically uses useSafeArea

layoutbuilder is used to set constraints and change widgets based on the size of the parent widget, u can define the size of the widget
and use an if statement (without curly braces) to do changes based on the width or height of the parent widget,

Media query is used to change stuff based on screen properties like portrait mode and landscape mode, layoutbuilder is used to change
widgets based on the size of the parent widget.

the if statement in a column or row child only effects 1 widget, same with the else, any widgets after are displayed anyways
ofc its better to make specific custom widgets for different widths and then use them in the if statements to make the code less
confusing

u can use an if statement to check the platform and then make changes based on the platform (android or ios), 
use if(platform.isIos or platform.isAndroid) and there are ios specific styles that u can import, google them.
