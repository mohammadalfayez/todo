How UI is updated in flutter

The UI is updated every time the build method is called, state changes trigger build methods,
then after that, a new widget tree is constructed since widget trees are immutable and cannot
change so a new one needs to be constructed every time.

The new widget tree is then compared with the old one to determine changes, after that, the
element tree is updated based on the determined changes, the element tree is mutable so it
just needs to be updated instead of creating a new one, then the render objects are updated
based on the element tree, the render tree is also mutable. so the items were not rerendered
again, only the additions/changed based on the render tree were rendered.


How to update UI while minimizing widget tree size:

Since a new widget tree is created when the UI is updated, executing setState() in a 
widget will automatically execute the build method. so it is better to move the widgets
affected by the setstate to another widget, so that way, only the widgets that are affected
by the setstate, ex: a button that changes text, (in this case the button and text are moved
to a seperate widget), that way, only the build method for the seperate widget is executed
and the widget tree size is way smaller since unaffected widgets will not be added.

What are keys

Keys are used to uniquely identify each widget, they are not automatically added and are used
to preserve the state of a widget, when the UI is updated, a new widget tree is created, but
not a new element tree, for an element tree to be able to match with each widget, it first
checks the type of the widget, and then checks if the widget has a key, if it dosent, it 
matches based on the type only, if it does, it matches with the widget that has the same key.
Since each stateful widget has a state, the state of the widget is not connected to each
widget, but to its element, so when a new widget tree is created and there are no keys for a 
stateful widget, the element will only match with the type, which means that the state might 
not match up with its widget, so in certain cases, assigning keys to stateless widgets allows
the flutter to assign an element and the state to a widget corresponding to it, it does that
by checking if the type and keys are the same. that way, when UI is updated, the state of a 
widget is preserved

Final vs const:
Final allows adding items to a list, but dosent allow modifying it or overriding values,
const dosent allow adding items or modifying or overriding values.
